  About Me
</h2>

      <p className="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify left">
  Hello! I’m <strong>R.M. Dilmini Shyawindi Senevirathne</strong>, an undergraduate student at the Institute of Technology, University of Moratuwa. I’m passionate about web development, graphic design, and portrait art.
  <br /><br />
  I specialize in both frontend and backend development, creating modern, responsive websites using technologies like React, Node.js, Express.js, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. I enjoy turning ideas into functional, user-friendly digital experiences, and I’m always eager to learn new technologies and tools to improve my skills.
  <br /><br />
  Outside of coding, I’m a creative at heart. As a graphic designer and portrait artist, I bring visuals to life — whether it’s through digital design or hand-drawn artwork.
